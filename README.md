This project is a simple ToDo List application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Users can register, log in, and manage their own tasks. Each user has a personal task list. The app includes features like adding, updating, deleting tasks, and marking tasks as complete. It uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication. The front-end is styled with a girly theme using CSS and Font Awesome icons. The back-end handles user authentication and task management.
